My main interest in life is to learn and stay free from those things that seem to keep people from changing and being happy.  I have found that what makes me happy is a sense of freedom.  For this to work, I have attempted to keep from having too much crap weighing me down.  I have avoided buying furniture.  I do have a car and some expensive electronics, but it could probably all go away if it had to.  I am still semi-regretting the fact that I need as much as I do, and in my most recent move (to California), I purged many things that were simply unnecessary.  Less is more, I say.

I graduated from college at Michigan State University in December of 2008 to work at Union Pacific Railroad as a Software Developer.  Now, I&#8217;m working as a developer at Google.  Life is good, and I am always amazed at how far I&#8217;ve come, but how much is still out there to know.

I am passionate about Software Development and have consumed a lot of the buzzwords such as TDD, BDD, Kanban, and so on.  One of the common patterns in my learning is to dive into a technology or idea and mess with it enough to know where it fits into my own productivity goals.  I have been through enough of them to not even have to read &#8220;No Silver Bullet&#8221;.  Many of them help you to think in different ways though, and that&#8217;s really what I&#8217;m after.

So, I&#8217;ll be blogging about ideas I have about some of those topics.  Many of them probably about technology and programming languages or testing.  Some of them probably about life lessons in general.  I used to have another blog for that kind of stuff, but it turns out that having 2 blogs causes you to update half as often per blog! Who knew?
