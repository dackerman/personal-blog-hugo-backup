# Intro to the Series: &#8220;What I&#8217;m Learning Today&#8221;

Lately I&#8217;ve been thinking about how much I read on the bus to work, at night, when I&#8217;m waiting for something, and when I&#8217;m just bored. A lot of it goes in one ear and out the other it seems, or at least doesn&#8217;t stick for as long as I&#8217;d like it to. I could take notes, but I generally forget where they are, and have terrible handwriting. Not only that, but a lot of the things I am learning are likely things other people are in the position to learn as well.

Therefore, I think I&#8217;ll try and record the one major thing that I learned each day, and put it here. That means the blog posts will likely be really short, but I&#8217;m pretty confident that it will be at least useful to someone out there on the web. Also, there will probably be a few posts in a row that are about the same topic, since I&#8217;m likely going to find inspiration from a book (which of course I&#8217;ll give credit to). At any rate, I hope to be able to come back here and see a daily diary of what my brain is thinking about, and hopefully keep me from forgetting all those useful nuggets from the books I&#8217;m reading. If other people find it interesting or it causes them to dig deeper for their own learning, then that&#8217;s icing on the cake!

To kick it off, I&#8217;ll start with &#8220;episode 1&#8221; below:

# Ep. 1: Extreme Programming &#8211; Values, Principles, and Practices

I&#8217;m currently reading [Extreme Programming Explained: Embrace Change (2nd Edition)][1], and am just fascinated with how it&#8217;s written. He started with the &#8220;Values&#8221; for XP, then moved into &#8220;Principles&#8221;, and then finally to &#8220;Practices&#8221;. At first, it seems a little hokey to talk about the super-high level &#8220;values&#8221;, but reading it convinces me that any new process should be organized this way.  He explains how a practice is meaningless without a principle to guide it, and even a principle is useless without a high level value to give it purpose.

The Values are the high-level concepts that should always be true for a given practice. They don&#8217;t change. If you don&#8217;t believe in the values, then it doesn&#8217;t really make sense to even read the principles or practices.  However, they are also extremely high level and don&#8217;t have a clear path to action. With only values, you really can&#8217;t implement any process.

For principles, they are generally true (to the author), but might not be complete. In a way, the principles can be &#8220;derived&#8221; from the values. You can experiment with it, and come up with new ones that are consistent with the higher level values without feeling like you&#8217;re doing something wrong.

The practices are at the lowest level. They are more suggestions of how to follow a principle than statements of fact. Things like &#8220;we write a failing test before we write production code&#8221; are deemed useful practices for Kent, but don&#8217;t necessarily work for every team (at first). They are up to interpretation, and can be done in different ways to achieve the same principles.

I really like the way this is explained, because it doesn&#8217;t just say &#8220;do X, then Y, then Z or you&#8217;re doing it wrong&#8221;. It gives you all the tools to reason about XP yourself, and implement it in any way that is working for you &#8211; after which you can iterate on the concept and get better over time. It doesn&#8217;t really force anything, but tries to convey why each value, principle, and practice is useful so you have a good foundation for being successful. I reminds me of a well written software library. There are high level interfaces that are rock solid and easy to understand &#8211; and then the implementation comes with it. However, you can change the implementation and still keep the interface working. Even better, it seems you can use some of his values across more than just XP &#8211; it&#8217;s high level enough for me to feel like I learned something even when thinking about other software development methodologies.
