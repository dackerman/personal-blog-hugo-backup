I always struggle to write blog posts.  I generally get super excited after reading posts by Steve Yegge, who generally inspires me to write something of my own (like it&#8217;s doing right now &#8211; check out &#8220;[saving-time][1]&#8221; if you want to know what prompted this).  I get all excited, and start dreaming up scenarios of what it would feel like to have posted something awesome like he always seems to do.

Then I start writing.

The reality sets in that I usually don&#8217;t know what I&#8217;m talking about.  Especially topics which I _like_ to talk about (like programming topics I don&#8217;t fully understand), I only have a vague idea of what is _right_ and what is _wrong._ And for some reason I don&#8217;t want to be horribly wrong.  I guess the permanence of the internet drives that emotion.  What if my children see my horrific design patterns and stop sending me birthday letters when I&#8217;m 60?

I second guess myself constantly, and over time, convince myself that what I was trying to write isn&#8217;t worth writing.  It&#8217;s not fully baked.  It&#8217;s too obvious or simplistic.  Those poor words then get neglected forever, never to be read or appreciated.

I guess it&#8217;s a matter of effort.  It should be easy to throw a few hundred words on a page and make some general point about software development. Enough of those and you become a &#8220;visionary&#8221;. But it&#8217;s way harder than it looks, and it feels like I&#8217;m dragging myself through a thick river of molasses, trying to get to the end of the post.  Once I get to the end, I may be done, but I&#8217;m still covered in molasses.  I&#8217;m still tentative to hit the &#8220;publish&#8221; button.

Well, not this time.  This one is going out right now, and I hope to publish more of my _old_ ideas in the near future.

I suppose I can always change my name if worse comes to worse!
