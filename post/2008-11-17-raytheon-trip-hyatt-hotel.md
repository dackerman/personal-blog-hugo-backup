      I&#8217;m in Boston, MA right now getting ready to go on my trip to IADC (Integrated Air Defense Center) in Andover, MA.  Sounds fun! I don&#8217;t have any interviews today; just touring Raytheon and then a formal dinner at 6pm.  Tomorrow I will go through a series of interviews and then be done around 1:30pm.
