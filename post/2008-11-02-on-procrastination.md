In my last semester here at Michigan State, I&#8217;m working on a web development project with three other classmates. We are supposed to be ready to present our beta demo tomorrow for class, but since we have 9 groups and only 2 groups can present on a given day, it takes 4.5 class periods to get through them all. The professor doesn&#8217;t post the dates that each group is going to present until the day before, in the hopes that everyone will be &#8220;done&#8221; with their demos even if their presentation isn&#8217;t due for a week. Little did our professor know, we still had lots of work to do! We just found out that our project doesn&#8217;t need to be presented until next Wednesday, and my teammates just sent a flurry of emails around to the effect of &#8220;whew! now we have plenty of time!&#8221; Something tells me we will be in the same boat next Tuesday night trying to scramble to get our beta demo working&#8230;

  Procrastination is a huge problem. <span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space: pre;"> </span>I have noticed time and again that when you give someone a task that they don&#8217;t want to do, they wait until the last possible second to do it. I mean, I would understand if you ask someone under 18 to do a task and they try to get around it. They play by high school rules, and that&#8217;s normal. You have no control, and you&#8217;re constantly resisting so you can play video games. But what about when you are in college? When yo u start your career? It still happens!

  I also know this to be the case with even professional developers. This is why agile seems to work better than waterfall. If you give them a task and then have daily status meetings, then they HAVE to get something done or they look like slackers. If you give them the requirements and then come back in 6 months, they will most likely not be done.

  I think I partially alluded to the lesson i&#8217;m trying to get at here.</p> 
  
  <p>
    <span style="font-weight: bold;">You need to set small, achievable, frequent goals for yourself and others.</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Usually the only time that someone is going to say they aren&#8217;t busy is if they actively have <span style="font-style: italic;">nothing </span>to do. This means they have not only written off work-things to do, but they have also depleted their list of time-wasters and want you to entertain them. They are <span style="font-style: italic;">bored.</span>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Therefore, the point is to be truly really <span style="font-style: italic;">busy </span>when you are working &#8211; and work hard. And then when you have times of free time, you can really enjoy it. Obviously, you need to take breaks, but those 3-hour long StumbleUpon journeys are cutting into your productivity. It&#8217;s way too easy to get distracted (especially when online, which is <span style="font-style: italic;">always</span>).
  </p>
  
  <p>
    I would suggest a good way to do this is to actually keep a list of things to do. I have a simple Google Desktop app as a to-do list. This isn&#8217;t perfect because I can&#8217;t see it across multiple computers. However, it works for me. I can see how much I <span style="font-style: italic;">really </span>have to do, and plan accordingly (plus it really feels good to click that little checkbox and make the image shoot to the bottom :).

      How do you keep from entering an infinite loop of Google Reader, Twitter/Friendfeed, email?</div>
