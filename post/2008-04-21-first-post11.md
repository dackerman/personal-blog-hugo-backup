Yeah, first post on myself. I feel proud. Well, anyway, this is going to be a blog about my experiences in Computer Science and Software Engineering. Maybe a little like Coding Horror. You can never have enough opinions, right? I have ideas and opinions bursting from me like a baby alien hatching from its human shell, so I will be logging them here. Feel free to join in on the discussion by comments or email.
