This is a little bit of a rant, but here goes.

I was listening to the [Javascript Jabber][1] podcast, and came across [episode 18 &#8220;Agile Development&#8221;][2] (This is a great podcast, by the way. They talk about a wide range of topics that don&#8217;t always directly deal with Javascript).  This rant got started because of this episode, but after listening to the whole thing, I&#8217;m no longer directing this post at them. However, it still applies to people who want to &#8220;do XP&#8221;. So, what got me going?

Someone on the podcast asked &#8220;what&#8217;s the difference between agile and extreme programming?&#8221;. The one that is experienced in agile spoke up and did admit that he wasn&#8217;t super familiar with XP. He then said he doesn&#8217;t know many of the practices other than &#8220;Pair Programming&#8221;, but that it seems like it&#8217;s a methodology **with very strict rules about what you can and can&#8217;t do**. Someone else chimed in to say _&#8220;so you&#8217;re saying that XP provides a lot of processes and tools so that we can value individuals and interactions over processes and tools?_&#8220;. They all laughed, but then awkardly agreed that yep, it is. What???

I don&#8217;t believe XP is all about rigid rules. From the XP book, it doesn&#8217;t say that everything will work for a team, or that you have to do everything all at once to get a benefit. The book even mentions that some practices will likely be dangerous if applied too early (like a daily build when you have piles of bugs and no testing). Too many companies try to just &#8220;Do XP&#8221; which usually means taking the easiest to understand principles (pair programming, launch every week, estimate features) and force them on the developers all at once. No care is paid to what is and isn&#8217;t working, and it will be different for every team. I think the outcome in those cases are usually that people get angry about the changes, get bitter, and either leave or doom the project.

Later on in the podcast, they do talk about how XP can be adopted incrementally, so they get a thumbs-up from me. However, I know there are a lot of organizations out there that still think they can just adopt any new methodology in a couple weeks.

On my team, I plan to be sensitive enough to our productivity and happiness that we will slowly adopt XP as necessary.  I don&#8217;t even have an intention of fully transitioning if we aren&#8217;t realizing the benefits. That&#8217;s not to say that XP is &#8220;wrong&#8221; in that case, but if things aren&#8217;t working, then _something _is wrong by definition. The better option is to try and fix that problem before moving into harder and more disciplined practices.
