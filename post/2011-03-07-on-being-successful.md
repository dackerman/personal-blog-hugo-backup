So, I&#8217;m digging through my drafts folder and discovering some interesting posts.  This one is about the difficulty of success when you don&#8217;t always get all the breaks.  It&#8217;s a pretty depressing post, which is probably why I never hit &#8220;publish&#8221;, but in hindsight I find it interesting.

> I have recently been reading the hugely popular book [Outliers][1] by Malcom Gladwell. If you haven&#8217;t had the pleasure, he talks about people way above the curve &#8211; at the pinnacle of success. He cites such people as Bill Gates and Christopher Langan (smartest person in the world). Not only does he give a brief biography of their lives, but he also makes his case for <span style="font-style: italic;">how </span>they did it. And his reason is that their <span style="font-style: italic;">circumstances, environment, how they were raised, and their culture</span> makes or breaks these people&#8217;s success. For instance, Christopher Langan isn&#8217;t really considered &#8220;successful&#8221; dispite the fact that he is smarter than everybody else. His <span style="font-style: italic;">abilities </span>couldn&#8217;t overcome the poor environment he was raised in, and subsequently he couldn&#8217;t deal with the world in the same way that Bill Gates could. But this had to do much more with his upbringing and timing than his intelligence (although that definitely played a part).

Instead, I look back and see that it was nearly wasted. I was free to do whatever I wanted, so its not like I was TOLD I couldn&#8217;t do something. But my mind wasn&#8217;t developed enough to have the motivation or understand the importance of education that early. So I played video games and did a little programming.

Basically, he is in the 99th percentile in everything. Apparently his mom works at Tufts, so he can get in tuition-free there, but isn&#8217;t sure if he wants it! Think about his opportunities&#8230; they are miles ahead of someone going to a &#8220;state&#8221; school.

I drafted this almost 2 years ago (April 2009).  Since this post, I have moved to my dream spot (Silicon Valley), doing what I love (Software Development) at a company that treats me _really_ well (GOOG).  I guess you don&#8217;t need all the breaks after all!
