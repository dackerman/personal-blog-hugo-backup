Got this idea from a recent Seth Godin post.  See his <a href="http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2010/12/yearinreview.html" target="_blank">original article</a> if you&#8217;re curious.  Basically, the question is: what products, services, or movements did you launch in 2010?  Undoubtedly, many of us started diets, but never really followed through.  Or maybe we thought about starting several different businesses throughout the year.  Thinking about launching, half-launching, or just starting something (without launch) doesn&#8217;t count.  Seth unsurprisingly has a huge list, including shipping &#8220;Linchpin&#8221;, Squidoo progress, launching Nano MBA program, and raising money for charity.

Me, not so much.

Nevertheless, I would like to write it down to give myself motivation for the current year and beyond.  What were the things I &#8220;shipped&#8221;?  I&#8217;m going to count accomplishments that weren&#8217;t physically shipped, because I think he means to &#8220;finish&#8221; a project more than anything else.

### Launched my messaging and library code into production at Union Pacific.

I had been working on this project for months, and finally launched the code into production in early 2010.  I consider it my most solid (or [SOLID][1]) test-driven app to date.  I also started up Hudson and Sonar instances for the rest of the dev team to use, despite them being hesitant about it.

### Interviewed with, and landed a job at Google.

I was referred by a friend at the company, and much stress ensued.  I didn&#8217;t get in the first time I applied (in 2009), but this time was different.  I stayed confident, and turned the interviews into a conversation.  It was great!  Living in California has been a dream of mine for a decade, and I nearly soiled myself when I landed in San Jose airport.  The palm trees were mesmerizing!  I studied as much as I could while admiring the amazing scenery of summer in the bay area.  Long story short, I got the job, and have been happily coding ever since.

### Started a Github repository, and am actively developing several open source apps.

Technically, this doesn&#8217;t count &#8211; since I haven&#8217;t actually &#8220;launched&#8221; any of these apps.  Well, I did &#8220;launch&#8221; a simple browser snowflake application, but that shows up as December 31, 2009 on github, so that doesn&#8217;t count either!  However, I am actively developing the projects, so I can&#8217;t really call it a failure.  I will take this as a reminder to move quickly in my software endeavors.  _The faster you finish projects, the more you learn, and quicker you can come up with new ones._ 

Anyway, this is my list, laid bare to the internet public.  Hoping for more solid launches in 2011!

### New year&#8217;s resolution

Experiment more, fail faster, and launch something amazing in 2011!

What did you launch?
