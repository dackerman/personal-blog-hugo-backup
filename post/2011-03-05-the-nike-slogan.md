It&#8217;s really important to know when to stop consuming, and when to start producing.

Anyone who wants to make a difference in the world has to learn their stuff somehow.  Generally, you can get that through schooling, reading online, buying books, or just trial and error.  The trial and error part is risky at first, because you have no idea what you&#8217;re doing.  Sometimes you don&#8217;t even know where to start, and that&#8217;s okay.

So, the natural choice is to start consuming material &#8211; find some well known authors and read their books on the subject, maybe take some classes in your area of interest.  However, there is a law of diminishing returns going down this path.

The longer you spend learning without taking risks, getting feedback, and failing, the harder it is to stop.  You get to a point where you&#8217;ve learned enough.  You need to recognize this inflection point and _put down_ the book.  _Try something._

Once you have learned the basics, it&#8217;s a good idea to try out your knowledge.  It&#8217;s going to be scary at first.  You will _never_ feel fully prepared to start producing things &#8211; it&#8217;s only after some amount of  trial and error that you get comfortable creating. If it&#8217;s a programming language you&#8217;re learning, _start programming._ If it&#8217;s a business, _make a prototype._ If you never get to this stage, you&#8217;ll never actually produce anything, and your dream will stay in your brain forever.

Take the risk, and ignore the urge to stay in your comfort zone.
