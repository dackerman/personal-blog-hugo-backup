I&#8217;m still reading [Extreme Programming Explained: Embrace Change 2nd Edition][1] on my Kindle (about 27% of the way through), so here&#8217;s another tidbit.

I&#8217;ve always thought that Extreme Programming was about making decisions in the near term, and trying not to make commitments far out into the future. Obviously, managers and customers don&#8217;t like to hear that &#8211; they want you to commit to a date with a certain number of features (with an implied quality), and be right on target. &#8220;When is everything going to be done&#8221; is the broken record that always comes from the customer &#8211; and it&#8217;s hard to blame them &#8211; it&#8217;s an important question to ask when spending more time costs money (and even has an opportunity cost when the team could be working on something else).

Despite my initial impression, I&#8217;m reading a section about the &#8220;Quarterly Cycle&#8221;. It talks about being able to plan a quarter at a time, and having several different goals for when a team does &#8220;quarterly planning&#8221;:

  * Reflect on what bottlenecks or issues are coming up week over week.
  * Commit to needed refactorings or otherwise fix up the system
  * Plan a theme for the quarter, and pick a quarter&#8217;s worth of stories that should address the theme.

I like this idea &#8211; as it lets the team focus on the week-to-week details of the system without worrying too much about the overarching goals (since the stories picked match a general high level theme).  Since we can&#8217;t focus on everything at once, it&#8217;s good to know that the features are part of a stable goal at the end of the quarter.

The only thing I am still not sure about is how you can reliably &#8220;pick a quarter&#8217;s worth of stories&#8221;. How do we know how many stories that is?  Should we just be intentionally vague about what that means? How do we ensure that we&#8217;re transparent about where we&#8217;re at and how do we correct for the inevitable underestimations? Kent mentions picking a few lower priority stories as &#8220;slack&#8221;, but from my experience, estimations can be 50% or more off mark, and many of the features requested by customers are unlikely to be well-defined at the beginning of the quarter.

I expect to find out what strategies work to make this planning accurate in the next 70% of the book, and will be sure to record it here. As always, if you&#8217;ve got advice or general comments, I&#8217;m open to discussion below.
